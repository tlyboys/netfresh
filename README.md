### Features

- List all network profiles with active/stale/offline status
- One-click cleanup of stale auto-numbered profiles + sequential renumbering
- Inline rename any profile by clicking its name
- Delete individual profiles with confirmation
- Auto backup before any destructive operation (exports .reg file)
- Dark/light theme
- i18n support (English / Chinese)

### How It Works

Windows creates a new network profile every time it detects a "new" network, auto-naming them "Network", "Network 2", "Network 3"... The numbers only go up, never reset. VPN / ZeroTier reconnects, router resets, and VM adapter changes all inflate the numbering.

Profiles are stored at:

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Profiles\{GUID}
```

Key fields: `ProfileName`, `Category` (0=Public, 1=Private, 2=Domain), `NameType` (0x6=auto-numbered, 0x35=custom name).

Cleanup logic:

1. Backup registry to `.reg` file
2. Delete inactive auto-numbered profiles
3. Renumber remaining active auto-numbered profiles sequentially
4. Skip custom-named profiles
